Collaborative incubation effort focused on the validation of decentralized identity technologies and concepts in the domain of Employee Onboarding and Professional Learning.

IBM HR, SCOIR and their academic partners have set out to collaborate on validating the ease at which trusted digital credentials can be used for onboarding ew employees from a range of academic backgrounds into enterprises. The goal here is to demonstrate the **nimbleness** that ecosystem stakeholders can quickly and easily comprehend the value that trusted digital credentials will bring to their sharing and verification interactions for academic and professional achievements. Playing on the concept of a **nym**, (pronounced NIHM and a shortened form of "pseudonym,") as a mechanism for concealing and protect privacy on the Internet -- the **nymble ecosystem** is focused on the validation of decentralized identity technologies and concepts in the domain of Employee Onboarding and Professional Learning.
